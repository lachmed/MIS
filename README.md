# MIS
## Medical image segmentation project

In this mini-project, we provided an overview about medical image segmentation 
and the methods that are used to approach this problem.
Then we applied thresholding, kmeans clustering and three different deep learning models and compared the results.

A detailed presentation is provided as a pdf file under the title : "Proj Initiation Ã  la rechereche (MIS).pdf"
